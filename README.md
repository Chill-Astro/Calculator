### What are Scripted Actions?

Scripted Actions are the core feature that sets this calculator apart. Instead of performing one-off calculations, you can utilize predefined actions for specific tasks. Simply input the required values for a chosen action, and the calculator provides the output.

**Example:** The **Heron's Formula Page** allows you to input the lengths of a triangle's sides and instantly get its area.
